# adventCalendarSolutions
This is a collection of all the solutions that earned me gold stars for the adventofcode challenge.
I admit, the code can be pretty hacky, but the stars speak for themselves. I started 12 days late on 
the challenge, so I'm playing catch up. I might take more time to write cleaner solutions once I'm
caught up, but I make no promises!
